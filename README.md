## Hi there 👋
## My name is Sai Sreenivas Reddy Karra 
==================
## Computer Science Graduate student graduated from Saint Louis University.
==================
I am a skilled Data Engineer passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation and optimize products and solutions; looking for Software Engineer/Software Developer Internship in the Summer of 2024 and a Co-Op in the Fall of 2024. 

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (USC), Expected to graduate in December 2024. I bring to the table a solid academic foundation and three years of practical industry experience.

In my previous role at General Electric (GE), I spearheaded the development of scalable cloud-native products, resulting in a 90% increase in cloud admin teams' productivity. I architected and implemented a real-time monitoring framework, reducing person-hours by 80%. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in automating cloud infrastructure provisioning and access control pipelines, significantly reducing project creation and deployment time.

I possess a solid technical skill set, including Python, R, Java, Tableau, Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). With proficiency in Data management, REST API development, Agile methodologies, Software development lifecycles, and Web technologies.

Furthermore, my research experience in Predicting Malicious Activity in Android using Machine Learning and NLP-driven Political Analysis of Subreddits demonstrates my ability to apply advanced techniques to solve real-world challenges and make an impact.

I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a dynamic organization that values innovation and growth. Please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn to talk about opportunities or project collaborations.
